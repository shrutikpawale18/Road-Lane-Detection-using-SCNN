# Road-Lane-Detection-using-SCNN

Abstract:   

 

In this project, we address the challenge of traffic lane detection, a critical component in the advancement of autonomous driving systems. Our objective is to create a reliable system that can accurately detect and track lane markings over a range of road conditions and environmental factors. The proposed system is engineered to recognize various lane patterns, such as straight, curved, continuous, and dashed lines, and is robust to variations in traffic density, lighting, weather conditions, and road surface quality. 

 

We introduce a Spatial Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) as our core methodological approach. The SCNN architecture excels in processing spatial information, enabling it to interpret complex visual cues and relationships within the data. By incorporating lateral connections and hierarchically structured layers, the SCNN can infer the trajectory of lanes, adapting to instances where markings are occluded, worn, or otherwise difficult to discern. 

 

The dataset utilized for training includes a diverse set of images that simulate a variety of driving scenarios, enhancing the model's generalizability. Our evaluation metrics—precision, recall, and F1-score—reflect the system's accuracy and reliability in real-world conditions. 

 

The SCNN-based system demonstrates significant potential for enhancing vehicular navigation and safety, marking a step forward in the development of autonomous driving technology.
